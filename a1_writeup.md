# Assignment 1 - Write UP

## Description
This is the portion of the assignment that will be graded.  I will be looking at your other files, and specifically either `a1.py` or `a1_ai_problems.py`.  I will be looking to see that you completed the problems or used a generative AI to help you come up with and complete some challenge questions.  This document will help guide you through that process.

## Options for Assignment 1
- Complete the `a1.py` file completely and answer the reflection questions in this file.  Mr. Berg will be looking at both files.
- Complete the `python_with_generative_ai.md` and put your programming portions in `a1_ai_problems.py`.

Mr. Berg will look at all your files to determine what you have completed.  If there are any questions for this assignment, Mr. Berg will ask in class after he grades them.


## Reflection Questions

1. What is your initial thoughts about the python programming language?

I think that for the most part, python is easy enough to understand, its different from Java where instead of typeing System.out.print, you only need to type print(). I think that this makes the language easier to read, but I am still unfamiliar with the langueage which makes it more difficult for me to understand.

2. Describe some similarities and differences that you found between python and other programming languages you have used in the past?

Python is simpler than other programing languages. In python you only need to write def to define a funtion, instead of private String... as you would in Java. This makes it easier to read python.There are also some problems that are much simpler to solve in python than java.

3. What are some things that you learned through this assignment?

Through this assignment I was able to learn the "java" way to solve problems, and the "python" way. This helped me understand the differences between the two languages and learn simpler ways to solving the problems. I found this really interesting how some problems that would typically take multiple lines of code to solve in java, were able to be solved in a single line in python.
